since opencv.framework exceeds github 100mb limit, I've listed it in the .gitignore. This means you must download the framework from this link https://github.com/Fl0p/OpenCV-iOS/tree/master/opencv2.framework and drag the opencv2.framework folder into the xcode project under the directory: opencv-demo/ (not opencv-demo/opencv-demo)
